# Predicting-the-activity-of-drugs-on-COVID-protein


* Using chembl library to scrape protein bank from the internet 
* search for COVID discovered proteins choosing one 
* search for all the drugs that been tested their activity of this protein 
* explore and clean the data 
* calculate some descriptors to use it as features of predictive model 
* create many models then choosed the best models (with highest scores) 
* use grid search to fine tune the hyperparameters 
* collect the best models in the specified hyperparameter space 
* combine them in ensemble model
