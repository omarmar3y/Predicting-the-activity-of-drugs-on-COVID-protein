# Predicting-the-activity-of-drugs-on-COVID-protein
Using chembl library to scrape protein bank from the internet and search for COVID discovered proteins choosing one and searching for all the drugs that been tested their activity of this protein then after exploring and cleaning the data I calculate some descriptors to use it features of predictive model then I create some model pipelines and use grid search to fine tune the hyperparameters and use the best model in the specified hyperparameter space and combine them in ensemble model
